# website-performance-hoc

[![npm package][npm-badge]][npm]

Wrap react components with a HOC measuring page performance metrics. This packages assumes you're tracking via segment and is simply providing a react-y HOC implementation of the [website-performance](https://github.com/hanford/website-performance) npm module.

## Usage

If you've loaded segment globally, and are guranteed to have window.analytics defined before your code runs .. integrating is as easy as:
```js
import withPerformance from 'website-performance-hoc'

class MyPage extends React.PureComponent {
  ...
}

export default withPerformance(window.analytics)(MyPage, { eventName: 'Performance.Track' })
```

In other cases, you may have asynchronously loaded a tracking library. Integrating would then look something like this:

```js
import withPerformance from 'website-performance-hoc'
import Segment from 'load-segment'
const analytics = Segment({ key: .. })

class MyPage extends React.PureComponent {
  ...
}

export default withPerformance(analytics)(MyPage)
```

`website-performance-hoc` can take any analytics provider as long as it has a `.track()` method, so it should work with Google analytics and Segment. If you're using an analytics provider that doesn't have a `.track()` method, please [open an issue](https://github.com/hanford/website-performance-hoc/issues/new).

We're using `componentDidMount` in the `HOC` which can be invoked before the `DOM` has loaded. In that case, we set `window.onload` to retry tracking once the window has loaded. We're also deferring the track call to when the browser has free cycles using [request-callback](https://github.com/hanford/request-callback).
